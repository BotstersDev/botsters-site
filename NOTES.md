# Development Notes

## Branding Image

The BostersNoir.png image was not found at any of the specified paths:
- /opt/seksbot-shared/pics/
- ~/Sync/pics/ 
- /Users/aeonbyte_seksbot/projects/seksbot-shared/pics/
- /Users/aeonbyte_seksbot/projects/seksbot-shared/assets/

The site is built without the branding image. When the image is located, it should be:
1. Added to `public/` directory
2. Referenced in the hero section of the landing page  
3. Used for the OG image (currently just a placeholder)

## OG Image
The `public/og-image.png` is currently just a placeholder text file. Should be replaced with a proper 1200x630px image featuring Botsters branding with dark background and tagline.

## Domain Setup
Site is ready for deployment but domain needs to be configured by Peter before going live at botsters.dev.

## Design Consistency
The site follows the "three levels deep" consistent design system as requested:
- CSS variables for colors and fonts
- Consistent component patterns  
- Dark noir theme with amber/red accents
- Mobile-first responsive design
